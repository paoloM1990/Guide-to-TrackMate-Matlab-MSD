Generation of Trackmate tracks for C9orf72-DPRs and Mean Square Displacement analysis with relative graphs

For the MSD(Î”t) analysis on DPR trajectories in primary mouse cortical neurons, we firstly used TrackMate for producing DPR tracks and then we implemented the MATLAB class @msdanalyzer written by Jean-Yves Tinevez (https://github.com/tinevez/msdanalyzer, GitHub), already used in a previous study (Tarantino et al., 2014) and explained in its details (Miura & Sladoje, 2020). MSD plots and Log-Log fit plots were produced with MATLAB R2018b using the aforementioned class. A detailed explanation of how the analysis was performed (from the generation of Trackmate tracks for C9orf72-DPRs to the production of graphs after MSD analysis) is shown here as a PDF file.
